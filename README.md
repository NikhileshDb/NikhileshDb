👋 Hi, I'm Nikhilesh Debbarma
  🔧 Software Developer | AI Enthusiast | Full-Stack Engineer
  📍 Currently working on real-time defect detection, image processing, and backend system design.

💼 What I Do:
  🔍 Build AI-powered image processing systems using YOLO, OpenCV, and segmentation networks (e.g. ATNet with CBAM).
  
  ⚙️ Architect robust FastAPI backends with SQLModel, WebSockets, and real-time updates.
  
  🧠 Integrate machine learning workflows with strategy patterns, decorators, and modular design (SOLID principles).
  
  📊 Manage DICOM-based workflows and data pipelines for industrial inspection systems.
  
  🖥️ Develop cross-platform applications with Electron + React, Flutter, and Windows-native APIs.
  
  🧪 Work with technologies like SQLite, Watchdog, threading, and PDF generation using Python.
  
🧰 Tools & Tech:
  Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, Pandas
  
  React, Flutter, Electron, Next.js
  
  OpenCV, YOLO, Pillow, NumPy
  
  WebSockets, Threading, PDFKit, TQDM
  
  Git, Docker, Linux/Windows environments
  
📚 Currently Learning:
  C++ fundamentals and system-level programming
  
  Advanced Pandas, OpenPyXL, and functional programming
  
  Efficient database design and async patterns
🚀 Goals:
  Deliver clean, maintainable code with modern architecture patterns
