👋 Hi, I'm Nikhilesh Debbarma

🔧 Software Developer | AI Enthusiast | Full-Stack Engineer📍 Currently working on real-time defect detection, image processing, and backend system design.

💼 What I Do:

🔍 Build AI-powered image processing systems using YOLO, OpenCV, and segmentation networks (e.g. ATNet with CBAM).

⚙️ Architect robust FastAPI backends with SQLModel, WebSockets, and real-time updates.

🧠 Integrate machine learning workflows with strategy patterns, decorators, and modular design (SOLID principles).

📊 Manage DICOM-based workflows and data pipelines for industrial inspection systems.

🖥️ Develop cross-platform applications with Electron + React, Flutter, and Windows-native APIs.

🧪 Work with technologies like SQLite, Watchdog, threading, and PDF generation using Python.

🪰 Tools & Tech:

Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, Pandas

React, Flutter, Electron, Next.js

OpenCV, YOLO, Pillow, NumPy

WebSockets, Threading, PDFKit, TQDM

Git, Docker, Linux/Windows environments

📚 Currently Learning:

C++ fundamentals and system-level programming

Advanced Pandas, OpenPyXL, and functional programming

Efficient database design and async patterns

🚀 Goals:

Deliver clean, maintainable code with modern architecture patterns

Master real-time data pipelines and streaming protocols like RTP/RTSP

Build scalable AI-powered industrial applications
